Now, you've lost your crew.

335

Jack Sparrow is
no longer our captain.

336

You're all dismissed. Eh?

341
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,762
All of ya, dismissed.

342
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,389
You'll never sail with
Captain Jack Sparrow again,

00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,474
tell you that.

The only survivor
of the Monarch.

346
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,611
A boy who paddled
all the way to Saint Martin

347
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,030
against the tide
on a piece of driftwood.

348
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,785
Found jabbering about pirates
and tridents.

349
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,287
Please, sir,
let me go of these chains.

350
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,874
My job is to protect
this island and these waters.

351
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,627
And your sleeves
have been ripped.

352
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,380
The mark of treason.

353
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,798
We were attacked
by the dead...

354
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,967
You're a coward
who ran from battle.

355
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,511
And that is how you'll die.

356
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,066
I don't believe
you're a coward.

357
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,651
Please leave me, sister.

358
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,112
I've risked my life
to come here,

359
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,822
to see if the rumors are true.

360
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,490
You speak of the Trident?

361
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,492
Who are you?

362
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,870
Tell me why you seek
the Trident.

363
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,999
The Trident can break
any curse at sea.

364
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,335
My father is trapped
by such a curse.

365
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,838
You're aware that curses
are not supported by science.

366
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,089
Neither are ghosts.

367
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,176
So you have gone mad?
I should never have come here.

368
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,844
Then why did you come here?

369
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,054
Because I need to
get off this island.

372
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,563
You've read the ancient text?

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,232
In each language
they were written.

374
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,070
But this map has never been
seen nor read by any man.

375
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,865
Luckily, I'm a woman.

376
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,913
This is the diary
of Galileo Galilei.

377
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,624
He spent his life
searching for the Trident.

378
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,459
It's why he invented
the spyglass...

379
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,085
why astronomers have
spent their lives

380
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,212
staring into the sky.

381
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,257

is hidden in the stars?

383
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,552
It was left to me
by my father.

384
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,014
He believed I could find
what no man has ever found

385
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,099
and I will not let him down.

386
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,894
Soon there will be
a blood moon.

387
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,313
Only then can the map be read.

388
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,398
And the Trident found.

You've spoken to them?

Have you spoken to krakens
and mermaids as well?

spend more time at sea.

come to me, Carina?
